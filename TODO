Below is a list of items that could (should?) be added to Herrie's
sourcecode. Feel free to implement them. Patches are, as always, very
welcome.

Graphical user interface:
- Allow numeric multipliers just like vi
- Add copy/paste functionality to playlist
- Use different colors for files, playlists and directories
- Add filtering feature instead of searching, just like Mutt has
- Recursive searching
- Show whether repeat is turned on
- Make startup-configuration of repeat-switch configurable

Audio abstraction:
- Add support for volume control
- Fully implement more audio file formats
  - Apple Lossless
  - WMA
  - AAC
- CD playback
  - CDDB
- 5.1 support?
- Make ALSA buffer size configurable

Virtual filesystem:
- Add some kind of 'recursive' VFS: playlists on HTTP
- Perform more testing on XSPF compliance

Documentation:
- Usage guide
- Write a developers guide?
