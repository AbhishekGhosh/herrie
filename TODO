welcome.

  - Store in XSPF; extend format to store datetime

Audio abstraction:
- Add support for volume control
- Fully implement more audio file formats
  - Apple Lossless
- CD playback
  - CDDB
- 5.1 support?

Virtual filesystem:
- Add some kind of 'recursive' VFS: playlists on HTTP
- Perform more testing on XSPF compliance

Documentation:
- Usage guide
- Write a developers guide?
