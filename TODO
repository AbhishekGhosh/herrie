Below is a list of items that could (should?) be added to Herrie's
sourcecode. Feel free to implement them. Patches are, as always, very
welcome.

Graphical user interface:
- Add curses mouse support
- Allow numeric multipliers just like vi
- Add copy/paste functionality to playlist

Scrobbler:
- Allow Scrobbler queue to be dumped on closure (send them next time)
- Resolve 'post.audioscrobbler.com' before chroot()

Audio abstraction:
- Add support for volume control
- Fully implement more audio file formats
- Web streaming
- CD playback
  - CDDB
- 5.1 support?

Virtual filesystem:
- Network addresses (for web streaming)

Documentation:
- Usage guide
- Write a developers guide?

In general:
- Make Herrie UTF-8 aware
  - Scrobbler code does not properly escape > 0x7f
  - Store strings in struct audio_file's tag as wide characters
  - Experiment with ncursesw library
  - Still remain portable...? (use glib functions?)
