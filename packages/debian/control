Description: Ncurses command line music player
 Herrie is a minimalistic music player that uses the command line. It is
 written to support a variety of operating systems, audio subsystems and
 file formats, including playlists.
 .
 Herrie has a split-screen user interface, with a playlist at the top of
 the screen and a file browser at the bottom. When tracks are added to
 the playlist, Herrie automatically consumes them one by one. It is thus
 an application that allows you to batch music for playback.
 .
 Herrie also has some more exotic features, including support for
 AudioScrobbler and the ability to chroot() itself into a directory.
