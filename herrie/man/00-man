.SH DESCRIPTION
.B herrie
is a command line music player. It supports multiple audio file formats
(including MP3 and Ogg Vorbis) and has the ability to send playback
statistics to AudioScrobbler. The word `herrie' is Dutch for `clamour'.
.PP
.B herrie
uses a split-screen user interface: a playlist at the top and a
filebrowser at the bottom. The application has two modes of operation,
called `party mode' and `XMMS mode'. When the application is started in
party mode, the first song in the playlist gets started. It will also be
removed from the playlist as well. When the application is started in
XMMS mode, any song can be started and will not be removed from the
playlist.  The default mode is party mode.
.PP
The following command line options are available:
.TP
.BI "-c " "configfile"

searches in
.I ~/.herrie/config
or in the system wide global configuration file
.I %%CONFFILE%%
for options. The

options allows you to load additional configuration files.
