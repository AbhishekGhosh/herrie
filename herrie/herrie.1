.SH NAME
herrie \- interactive music playlist player

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B herrie
[-vx] [-c configfile] [file ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B herrie
is a command line music player. It supports multiple audio file formats
(including MP3 and Ogg Vorbis) and has the ability to send playback
statistics to AudioScrobbler. The word `herrie' is Dutch for `clamor'.
.PP
.B herrie
uses a split-screen user interface: a playlist at the top and a
filebrowser at the bottom. The application has two modes of operation,
called `party mode' and `XMMS mode'. When the application is started in
party mode, songs are automatically started when they are added to the
playlist. Songs get removed from the top of the playlist. When the
application is started in XMMS mode, songs have to be started by hand
after they have been added to the playlist. The default mode is party
mode.
.PP
The following command line options are available:
.TP
.B -c configfile
By default,
.B herrie
searches in
.I ~/.herrie/config
or in the system wide global configuration file for options. The
.B -c
options allows you to load additional configuration files.
.TP
.B -v
Display version information and a list of supported file formats.
.TP
.B -x
This switch causes
.B herrie
to start up in XMMS mode.

.SH CONFIGURATION SWITCHES

.TP
.B G or end
Move the selection to the bottom.

matching entry below the current selection. If no match is found,
the search will continue at the top of the list.
.TP
.B n
Perform another search for the last entered search string.
.PP
There are also some bindings that only apply to the playlist:

.B d
Remove the currently selected song from the playlist.

.TP
.B R
Randomize the playlist.
.TP
.B [

.TP
.B ]

.PP
The file browser also has some bindings that allow you to traverse the
file system or add files, directories or playlists (M3U and PLS) to the
playlist:
.TP
.B a
Add items after the current selected item in the playlist.
.TP
.B A
Add items at the end of the playlist.
.TP
.B i
Add items before the current selected item in the playlist.

.TP
.B h or left arrow
Go one directory up.
.TP
.B l or right arrow
Enter the selected directory.
.TP
.B C
Change the current directory by entering a pathname. This pathname may
be relative to the current directory. When the address refers to a file
or web location, it will be displayed as well.
.PP
And last but not least, there are also some general keyboard bindings:
.TP
.B <
Seek 5 seconds backward.
.TP
.B >
Seek 5 seconds forward.
.TP
.B b
Go to the next song. Sending the signal
.B SIGUSR2
to the application will do the same.
.TP
.B c
Pause the current song. When
.B c
is pressed again, playback is resumed. Sending the signal
.B SIGUSR1
to the application will do the same.
.TP
.B J
Seek to a specific position. When the inserted time is prepended with a + or
-, the seek is performed relative.
.TP
.B q
Quit the application.
.TP
.B r
Switch repeat on and off. When this option is enabled, songs that have
been successfully opened will be added to the end of the playlist,
causing the playlist to repeat.
.TP

Stop playback. This button does the same as
.B b
in party mode, because in party mode playback is always started when
possible.
.TP
.B w
Write the current playlist to a PLS file.
.TP
.B x
When not in party mode, it starts the selected song. This button has no
effect in party mode, because songs are automatically started.
.TP
.B z
Go to the previous song.
.TP
.B ^L
Force the application to redraw itself.
.TP
.B ^W or tab
Switch the focus from the playlist to the file browser or vice versa.
