Hello and thanks for downloading Herrie!

This document will discuss a small set of subjects that will help you
install and use Herrie, but also ways to contact the developers to
report bugs and such.

- What is Herrie?
- How should I pronounce it?
- What kind of platforms will it run on?
- What are the dependencies of Herrie?
- How do I compile and install Herrie?
- I've installed it - now what?
- How do I contact you (report bugs, ask questions, etc)?

What is Herrie?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Herrie is a minimalistic music player that uses the command line. It is
written to support a variety of operating systems, audio subsystems and
file formats, including playlists.

Herrie has a split-screen user interface, with a playlist at the top of
the screen and a file browser at the bottom. When tracks are added to
the playlist, Herrie automatically consumes them one by one. It is thus
an application that allows you to batch music for playback.

How should I pronounce it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Herrie is actually a Dutch word. Its meaning is similar to the English
word 'clamor' (loud noise). Just pronounce it as the English given name
'Harry' and you are a long way.

What kind of platforms will it run on?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Herrie should compile without a flaw on the following operating systems:

- FreeBSD - 4.x and higher
- Linux - 2.2.x and higher
- Mac OS X - using MacPorts
- NetBSD - only tested on 3.x
- OpenBSD
- Cygwin

The application has been tested on little and big endian platforms, so
the chances are high it should just work on your obscure hardware as
well. At least Intel x86, SPARC and PowerPC should work.

What are the dependencies of Herrie?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Herrie is written in C and uses a lot of functions found in the GLib
library. It also uses some libraries for audio decompression and such.
Below is a list of libraries you should install prior to compiling
Herrie:

- gettext
- glib
- libao
- libcurl
- libid3tag
- libmad
- libsndfile
- libvorbisfile
- ncurses or pdcurses (`XCurses')
- openssl

Please note that some dependencies can be disabled. OpenSSL and cURL are
only needed when compiling with AudioScrobbler support. LibAO is only
needed when compiled with LibAO audio output support.

How do I compile and install Herrie?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Herrie ships with a GNU Makefile that allows you to compile Herrie in a
hopefully easy fashion. The Makefile also contains a set of switches to
disable various functions.

Below is a list of configuration switches:

- NO_LOCKUP=yes     disables chroot()/setuid() support
- NO_MP3=yes        disables support for MP3 audio playback
- NO_SCROBBLER=yes  disables AudioScrobbler support
- NO_SNDFILE=yes    disables support for libsndfile formats
- NO_TRANS=yes      disables gettext support (translations)
- NO_VORBIS=yes     disables support for Ogg Vorbis playback
- XCURSES=yes       build as an X11 application using XCurses

It is also possible to compile Herrie with support for a variety of
audio output frameworks:

- AUDIO_OUTPUT=oss	Open Sound System (Linux and xBSD)
- AUDIO_OUTPUT=ao	LibAO (may break when combined with chroot)

The following commands will compile and install Herrie without MP3 and
AudioScrobbler support:

	$ make NO_MP3=yes NO_SCROBBLER=yes
	$ sudo make NO_MP3=yes NO_SCROBBLER=yes install

Please notice that 'make' is called 'gmake' on operating systems that
already ship their own one (xBSD, Solaris, etc).

I've installed it - now what?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Herrie also comes with a manual page. The manual page contains some more
information about its basic usage and a list of configuration file
switches and keyboard bindings. Please take a look at it.

How do I contact you (report bugs, ask questions, etc)?
